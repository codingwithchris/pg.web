			<h5 class="_gray _width-max-1000 _c-block"><strong>It's an actor's job to breathe life into a story</strong>. Actors take audiences on a journey and have the power to teach people something they didn't know, or make them feel something they've never felt before. Acting is an amazing honor and a great responsibility. Above all else, at The Playground, we believe actors must always strive to <strong>make good art</strong>.</h5>
